# Hello, World!

Everything starts with a `Hello, World!`, and so does my blog. Welcome to my blog!
<!-- more -->
My name is Jake Anto and I am from India. More information about me can be found on the [homepage](../../index.md).

## About the blog

### Why did I start this blog?

The idea of starting a blog has been in my mind for a long time. After procrastinating for a while, I finally decided to start one, and here we are. If you are reading this, it means that I have successfully deployed my blog. Yay!

### What will the blog focus on?

I am planning to focus on writing posts related to technology. However, I'll also occasionally write about other fun stuff that piques my interest. Hopefully, I'll be featured in [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) someday. ðŸ˜„

### Why MkDocs?

Iâ€™m trying it out because it was quick to set up, but I haven't decided on it yet. Everything is subject to change in the first couple of weeks, since I'm not very experienced in making blogs. And I like to experiment. A lot.

If I stick with MkDocs, I'll make a post soon on why I chose it over other popular options, like Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby, etc.

## Mind my English

Since English is not my native language, forgive the occasional grammar mistakes. And the rare spelling errors too, as I am writing this on an IDE. Please [:octicons-issue-opened-24: raise an issue](https://github.com/j-eo/j-eo.github.io/issues/new) or [:octicons-git-pull-request-24: submit a pull request](https://github.com/j-eo/j-eo.github.io/compare) and I'll get to it as soon as I can.

## Thank you

Thank you for taking your time to read this. Hopefully, I'll not forget about this blog and continue posting content.

I would have encouraged you to subscribe to my blog, but there is no :material-rss:RSS support yet. ðŸ˜ž
